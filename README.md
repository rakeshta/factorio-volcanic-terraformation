# Volcanic Terraformation

A Factorio Space Age mod that introduces a two-stage terraforming process for converting lava into buildable terrain on Vulcanus.

Expand your industrial operations across volcanic landscapes through hazardous suppression and structural reinforcement. This mod bridges the gap between early-game lava restrictions and late-game Foundation technology, requiring careful planning and planetary resource coordination.

**Status:** In Development
